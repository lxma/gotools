# gotools
Standard library for go programming.

Contains tools for sets, mapping, futures, and others.

Note that I consider none of this being of noticable quality. Particularly, the implementation of sets is probably
not really efficient.

Also, some things are in a rather experimental state. (Is the Future function useful? What interface should the set
functions have?)

Still, the current state is sufficent for myself.
